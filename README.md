### This is a simple project about using API of web-resource
##### https://themoviedb.org
### with javascript
### The most comfortable way to use this web-resource is to invole on API libraries from the list:
##### https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api/wrappers-libraries
### For this project was used the library
##### https://github.com/cavestri/themoviedb-javascript-library/

### To use this project is enough to download file `index.html` and directory `scripts` with it's full content
### And open file `index.html` in any internet browser

##### because of some reasons querying for movies list on some bigger page (about over 1000) web-resource returns error 400
###### small note about cloning the project - use command `git clone --recurse-submodules <...>.git` to get it with submodule - js-library for fast work with API, refered as submodule.
